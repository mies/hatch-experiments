We are designing a CRUD API for a file sharing service. The API uses Cloudflare Workers with Hono and integrates with Cloudflare D1 (for storing file metadata) and Cloudflare R2 (for storing the actual file content). The relevant table is the files table defined in our Drizzle schema, with columns: id, file_id, file_name, content_type, size, uploaded_at, and r2_object_key. 

The endpoints we need to implement are:
1. POST /upload : For file uploads via multipart form-data. It validates the uploaded file (ensures the file exists and its size is below 2GB, i.e., 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes). It then generates a unique file identifier (using crypto.randomUUID), uploads the file stream to Cloudflare R2 with that unique identifier as part of the key, and inserts a record in D1 with metadata. Finally, it returns a JSON response with the file URL.

2. GET /file/:fileId : For retrieving the file. It looks up the file metadata in D1 by fileId, then gets the file from Cloudflare R2 using the r2_object_key, and then streams the file back. We add a TODO comment with a link to the Hono streaming docs if advanced streaming is needed.

3. PUT /file/:fileId : To update file metadata. For this example, we allow updating the fileName. It fetches the JSON body, validates the new fileName, and updates the record in D1 using Drizzle ORM.

4. DELETE /file/:fileId : To delete a file, both removing its metadata record in D1 and deleting the file from Cloudflare R2.

We have to remember to access environment variables from the context parameter (e.g., c.env.DB and c.env.R2), and to use Number.parseInt when converting numeric values if necessary (although for Date.now() it returns a number directly). We also include proper error handling for missing resources or invalid input. 

Finally, we remove any preexisting endpoints unrelated to this file sharing service from the template, so that only our desired endpoints remain in the file.
