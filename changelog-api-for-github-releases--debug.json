  "specContent": "# Changelog API Handoff Document\n\nThis document outlines the implementation for a Changelog API that listens for GitHub release events on a specific repository and sends out a changelog email immediately when a new release is detected.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe API will be built using Hono on Cloudflare Workers. It will expose a webhook endpoint that listens for GitHub release events. Once a release event is received and verified, the API will extract relevant release information (such as release title, version, release notes, and URL) and generate a changelog email. The email will then be sent to a predefined address via Resend.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n- **Edge Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers\n- **Framework**: Hono (TypeScript API framework, similar to Express.js)\n- **Email Service**: Resend\n\n## Environment Variables / Configuration\n\nThe following environment variables will need to be configured in Cloudflare Worker:\n\n- GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Secret for verifying the GitHub webhook signature.\n- RESEND_API_KEY: API key for sending emails via Resend.\n- EMAIL_FROM: The email address to use as the sender in the Resend API.\n- EMAIL_TO: The predefined recipient email address for the changelog.\n\nAdditional configuration:\n\n- Repository configuration: Hard-code the specific GitHub repository information (owner/repo) in the code if needed for extra verification.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. ### Set Up Webhook Endpoint\n   - Create a new Cloudflare Worker project using Hono.\n   - Define an endpoint (e.g., `/github-webhook`) that accepts POST requests from GitHub.\n   - Configure GitHub to send release events (webhooks) to this endpoint.\n\n2. ### Verify GitHub Webhook\n   - Implement signature verification using the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to ensure that the incoming payload is authentic.\n   - Use the appropriate hashing (e.g., HMAC with SHA-256) method to verify the X-Hub-Signature-256 header in the request.\n\n3. ### Parse the Release Event\n   - Ensure that the webhook event is specifically a \"release\" event.\n   - Extract the release details from the payload. Key details include:\n     - Release title\n     - Tag name / version\n     - Release notes (body)\n     - URL to the release\n   - Optionally, validate that the release is from the specific repository if needed (by checking repository name/owner).\n\n4. ### Generate the Changelog Email\n   - Format the extracted information into a well-structured changelog email content. For example:\n     - Subject: \"New Release: <Release Title>\"\n     - Body: Include version, release notes, URL, etc.\n\n5. ### Send Email via Resend\n   - Create a function that uses the Resend API to send emails.\n   - Construct the API request with the email content, using the following details:\n     - From: EMAIL_FROM\n     - To: EMAIL_TO\n     - Subject: Dynamically generated subject using the release title.\n     - Body: The formatted changelog.\n   - Use fetch (or an HTTP client) from within Cloudflare Workers to call the Resend API endpoint.\n   - Handle any errors or edge cases from the Resend API response.\n\n6. ### Error Handling & Logging\n   - Ensure that all steps have proper error handling, returning appropriate HTTP responses to GitHub (for example, 200 for successful processing, 400/500 for errors).\n   - Log errors and important events for debugging, using Cloudflare Workers logging facilities.\n\n7. ### Testing\n   - Simulate GitHub release events locally or in a staging environment.\n   - Verify that the endpoint correctly validates the webhook signature, parses event payload, and sends out the email via Resend.\n   - Test error handling cases (invalid payload, email service failure, etc.).\n\n8. ### Deployment & Monitoring\n   - Deploy the Cloudflare Worker using wrangler or via the Cloudflare dashboard.\n   - Monitor the deployment logs to ensure the API is functioning as expected.\n   - Optionally, set up alerts for webhook failures or email sending issues.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- Consider rate limiting or additional security measures if the endpoint might be exposed more widely in the future.\n- Document the API endpoint and configuration steps for future developers or maintainers.\n\nBy following this implementation plan, a developer should be able to set up and deploy a changelog API that listens for GitHub release events and sends an immediate changelog email through Resend.",
