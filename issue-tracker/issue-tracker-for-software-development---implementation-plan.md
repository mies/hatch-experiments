# Issue Tracker for Software Development Implementation Plan

This document outlines the design and step-by-step implementation plan for building an issue tracker for software development. The tracker will support operations on issues, projects, and tags, capturing details such as title, description, priority, status, assignee, and due dates. The system is to be built using Cloudflare Workers with Hono as the API framework, Cloudflare D1 as the database, and Drizzle for type-safe SQL queries.

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Edge Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers
- **API Framework:** Hono (TypeScript-based, Express-like syntax)
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (Serverless SQLite edge database)
- **ORM/Query Builder:** Drizzle for Cloudflare D1

## 2. Database Schema Design

We will create a relational data model using three main entities (Issues, Projects, Tags) and a join table for associating issues with multiple tags.

### 2.1. Issues Table

- id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- title (TEXT, required)
- description (TEXT, required)
- priority (TEXT, you might consider 'low', 'medium', 'high' as enum values)
- status (TEXT, e.g., 'open', 'in progress', 'closed')
- assignee (TEXT, for now simply a string identifier)
- due_date (DATE/TEXT)
- project_id (INTEGER, foreign key referencing Projects.id)

### 2.2. Projects Table

- id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- name (TEXT, required)

### 2.3. Tags Table

- id (INTEGER, Primary Key, Auto Increment)
- name (TEXT, required)

### 2.4. Issue_Tags Join Table

- issue_id (INTEGER, references Issues.id)
- tag_id (INTEGER, references Tags.id)

## 3. API Endpoints

We will structure our API endpoints into logical groups for issues, projects, and tags.

### 3.1. Issues Endpoints

- **POST /issues**
  - Description: Create a new issue.
  - Expected Payload:
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Issue title",
      "description": "Detailed description",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "open",
      "assignee": "Developer Name",
      "due_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "project_id": 1,
      "tags": ["bug", "frontend"]
    }
    ```

- **GET /issues**
  - Description: List all issues with optional filters (by project or tag).
  - Query Params: `project_id`, `tag`

- **GET /issues/:id**
  - Description: Retrieve details for a specific issue by ID.

- **PUT /issues/:id**
  - Description: Update an existing issue.
  - Expected Payload: JSON with any of the fields allowed to update.

- **DELETE /issues/:id**
  - Description: Delete an issue by ID.

### 3.2. Projects Endpoints

- **POST /projects**
  - Description: Create a new project.
  - Payload:
    ```json
    { "name": "Project Name" }
    ```

- **GET /projects**
  - Description: List all projects.

- **GET /projects/:id**
  - Description: Retrieve project details by ID.

- **PUT /projects/:id**
  - Description: Update project details.

- **DELETE /projects/:id**
  - Description: Delete a project by ID.

### 3.3. Tags Endpoints

- **POST /tags**
  - Description: Create a new tag.
  - Payload:
    ```json
    { "name": "Tag Name" }
    ```

- **GET /tags**
  - Description: List all tags.

- **GET /tags/:id**
  - Description: Retrieve details for a specific tag.

- **PUT /tags/:id**
  - Description: Update a tag.

- **DELETE /tags/:id**
  - Description: Delete a tag.

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1. Project Setup

- Initialize a new TypeScript project.
- Set up Cloudflare Workers environment using Wrangler.
- Install dependencies:
  - hono
  - drizzle-orm (along with any necessary adapters for D1)
  - Any utility libraries for handling dates and validation if needed.

### 4.2. Database Setup with D1 and Drizzle

- Define schema files (e.g., schema.ts) using Drizzle to create the tables outlined above.
- Write migration scripts if needed (or simply ensure schema sync with Cloudflare D1 initialization).

### 4.3. API Server Implementation with Hono

- Create a main entry point (e.g., index.ts) that sets up the Hono app.
- Define middleware for handling JSON parsing and error handling.
- Register route handlers for each of the endpoints described above.

### 4.4. Endpoint Handlers

- For each endpoint, implement business logic:
  - Validate incoming JSON requests.
  - Use Drizzle to execute SQL queries against Cloudflare D1.
  - Implement logic for associating tags with issues (inserting into the Issue_Tags join table).
  - Support filters in GET endpoints, e.g., filtering issues by `project_id` and/or a specific tag.

### 4.5. Error Handling and Response Structure

- Ensure that each API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
  - 200 for success,
  - 201 for creation,
  - 400 for bad requests,
  - 404 for not found, etc.
- Return consistent JSON error messages in error scenarios.

### 4.6. Testing

- Write unit tests and integration tests for each endpoint.
- Use Postman or similar tools to manually test REST endpoints.

### 4.7. Deployment

- Configure Wrangler with a proper wrangler.toml file for deploying Cloudflare Workers.
- Ensure environment variables and database credentials are correctly set up.
- Deploy to a Cloudflare Workers environment and validate the endpoints.

## 5. Documentation and Maintenance

- Comment code and provide inline documentation.
- Maintain an API documentation (using OpenAPI/Swagger if possible) to help front-end or third-party integration.
- Set up logging for debugging and performance monitoring.

## 6. Next Steps

Once the core functionality is implemented and stabilized, consider:

- Adding user management and authentication later (potentially using Clerk).
- Integrating email notifications using Resend for issue updates.
- Enhancing real-time updates using Cloudflare Durable Objects if needed.

This plan outlines a robust starting point to create an issue tracker with support for projects and tags using Cloudflare's edge infrastructure and type-safe database management. Follow each section and adjust where needed based on specific project constraints and future enhancements.

Happy coding!
